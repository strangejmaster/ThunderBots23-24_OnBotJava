-- [Training for New Drivers] --

Welcome to this quick training guide to become a new driver!

There are 3 driving modes:
* Mecanum
* Tank
* Arcade

Mecanum Driving Works as follows,
-Moving the left stick up will move the robot foward
-Moving the left stick down will move the robot backward
-Moving the right stick right will strafe the robot to the right
-Moving the right stick left will strafe the robot to the left
-Moving both the left stick up and the right stick right will cause the robot to move diagonally, 
this goes for all combinations
-The left and right trigger rotate the robot counterclockwise and clockwise respectively

Currently due to limitations in proccessing both Tank and Arcade drive the same,
they can be driven as follows
-Moving the left stick up will move the robot foward
-Moving the left stick down will move the robot backward
-Moving the right stick right will spin the robot in place clockwise
-Moving the right stick left will spin the robot in place counterclockwise
-Moving both the left stick up and the right stick right will cause the robot to move and rotate
-The left and right trigger work the same as the right stick
